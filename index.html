            <p>

            My name is Alex Tangeman. I'm in my 4th year here at UNO being a part time student studying MIS. I received my associated degree from Iowa Western Community College in 2017. I work for Veridian Credit Union as a Telephony Administrator. I've been with this company for almost 3 years now. Outside of work and school I enjoy biking, snowboarding, climbing and gaming.
